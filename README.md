# a self-developed platform with the self-written framework pawswork
I started this project last year because of Twitter's rebranding and with the hope of successfully launching a new platform of my own.
With this project I also learned about web development.
If possible I would release it this year and hopefully get new users :3

The "framework" is not yet finished and I strongly advise against using it for your own purposes
